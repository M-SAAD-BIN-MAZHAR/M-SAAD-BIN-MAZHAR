Hi, I’m @M-SAAD-BIN-MAZHAR, also known as Saadi. I’m passionate about programming and app development, with solid experience in C, C++, Java, and Python. I’m also an Android developer and the creator of Academix, a smart app that bundles multiple academic tools for students. My portfolio includes projects like a Typing Speed Tester, Tic Tac Toe, Voting Machines (in both C++ and Proteus), Rock Paper Scissors, Online Food Management System, Check Your Math's IQ, Guess the Number (in Java and Python), and a Console-Based To-Do List. I’m always eager to collaborate on innovative and impactful software projects, especially those involving Python, Java, C++, or Android development. I’m also passionate about learning Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, and excited to explore their real-world applications. You can reach out to me on Instagram at @prince_saad55.
